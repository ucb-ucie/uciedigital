# UCIe Digital IP

An open-source digital implementation of the UCIe 1.1 specification.

You can request a copy of the UCIe 1.1 specification [here](https://www.uciexpress.org/1-1-spec-download).

## Getting Started

Install [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/).
If you run into issues building the Scala code,
you may need to switch to Java 17.

To run the tests, run `sbt test` from the root of this repository.
To compile the code, run `sbt compile`.
To format the code using scalafmt, run `sbt scalafmt`.

If you are running `sbt` commands frequently, you may find it useful
to leave the sbt shell (launched by running `sbt` with no arguments) open.
You can then compile/test the code from the sbt shell.

## Documentation

See the [API documentation](https://ucb-ucie.github.io/uciedigital/edu/berkeley/cs/ucie/digital/index.html).
The API docs are updated automatically in continuous integration.
